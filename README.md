#### Anonym is a publication with the sole purpose of encouraging open and honest conversation on campus.

#### By allowing writers and editors to remain anonymous, they will be free to generate original, thought-provoking content which may not adhere to standard practices of discourse. As a result, readers will have access to the unadulturated thoughts of their peers.
